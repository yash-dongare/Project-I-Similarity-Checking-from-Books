**Note to Professor**

Dear Professor,

I wanted to inform you that I encountered technical limitations with my personal computer while attempting to implement multithreading in this project. Despite several efforts, the multithreaded version caused unexpected issues and system instability due to potential hardware or software compatibility challenges. To ensure reliable and accurate program functionality, I opted for a single-threaded implementation instead.

While I understand that multithreading was a preferred component, I focused on delivering a stable solution that fulfills all other requirements. The current version effectively accomplishes the main objectives of text analysis and book comparison.

Thank you for your understanding. 🙏🙏🙏
