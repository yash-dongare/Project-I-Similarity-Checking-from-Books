# 📚 Book Comparison Project

## 🎯 Overview
A powerful text analysis project designed to explore connections between 64 literary works. By applying advanced comparison algorithms, this project uncovers hidden patterns and similarities in classic literature.

## ✨ Key Features
- Identifies the 100 most frequently occurring, influential words across the book corpus
- Builds a detailed 64x64 similarity matrix for comprehensive book-to-book comparison
- Highlights the top 10 most similar pairs of books based on content analysis
- Processes and analyzes text with precision and efficiency
- Implements robust algorithms for text comparison and similarity measurement

## 📊 Results Highlight
Our analysis reveals interesting connections among books. Notable findings include:
- Gerard's Herbal volumes show remarkable similarity (91% match between Vol. 3 and Vol. 4)
- Memoirs of Laetitia Pilkington exhibits strong narrative consistency across volumes
- Foxes Book of Martyrs maintains a coherent theme across different parts

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Core Components
- **Custom Book class** for efficient text representation
- **Text preprocessing pipeline** to clean and prepare data
- **Sophisticated similarity calculation** using word frequency and normalization
- **Comprehensive word frequency analysis** for accurate comparison

### Technology Stack
- **Language**: C++
- **Data Format**: Raw text files
- **Analysis Method**: Statistical and frequency-based text comparison

## 📈 Performance
The program processes all 64 books efficiently, completing:
- Full word frequency analysis across the entire corpus
- 2,016 unique book-to-book comparisons
- Ranked similarity scores to identify the most similar pairs

## 🚀 Getting Started
1. Clone the repository.
2. Ensure all book text files are in the designated directory.
3. Compile the C++ source files.
4. Run the executable.
5. Find the generated results in the output directory.

## 📝 Output Files
The program generates several insightful output files:
- `common_words.txt`: Lists the top 100 most frequent words
- `similarity_matrix.txt`: Shows the complete similarity matrix
- `similar_books.txt`: Highlights the top 10 most similar pairs of books

## 🔍 Future Scope
Potential enhancements include:
- Integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Creating an interactive visualization dashboard
- Adding semantic analysis and genre classification features
- Expanding to multi-language support

## 💡 Technical Note
Currently, the project uses a single-threaded approach to maintain stability and reliability. While this may impact processing speed, it ensures consistent results across all system configurations.
